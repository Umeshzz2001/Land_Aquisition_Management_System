# Financial Officer Compensation Details Functionality

## Overview
This implementation provides comprehensive compensation details management specifically for Financial Officers in the Land Acquisition Management System.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
- **Financial Officers**: Full edit access to compensation details
- **Other Roles** (Chief Engineer, Project Engineer, Land Officer): View-only access
- Role detection based on current dashboard route (`/fo-dashboard`, `/pe-dashboard`, `/ce-dashboard`)

### 2. CompensationDetails Component
A new React component (`src/components/CompensationDetails.jsx`) that provides:

#### Compensation Assessment Fields:
- **Assessment Information**:
  - Assessment Date
  - Market Value

- **Compensation Breakdown**:
  - Property Valuation
  - Building Value  
  - Tree Value
  - Crops Value
  - Disturbance Allowance
  - Solatium Payment
  - Additional Compensation
  - **Auto-calculated Total Compensation**

- **Status Management**:
  - Payment Status (Pending, Approved, Paid, Partial Payment)
  - Approval Status (Draft, Submitted for Approval, Approved, Rejected)

- **Documentation**:
  - Notes and Comments
  - Last Updated information

### 3. Enhanced LotDetail Page
Updated `src/pages/LotDetail.jsx` to include:

- **Compensation Summary Section**: Visible to all users showing current status
- **Detailed Compensation Section**: Only accessible by Financial Officers
- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Compensation data is loaded from localStorage and updates lot valuation
- **Role-based UI**: Different interface elements based on user role

### 4. Data Persistence
- All compensation data is saved to `localStorage` under the key `compensationData`
- Data structure: `{planId}_{lotId}` as the key for each lot's compensation data
- Automatic calculation of total compensation when individual values change

### 5. User Experience Features
- **Edit Mode**: Toggle between view and edit modes
- **Auto-calculation**: Total compensation automatically updates as individual values change
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges for payment and approval status
- **Permission Messages**: Clear indication of edit permissions
- **Save Confirmation**: Success messages and error handling

## Usage Instructions

### For Financial Officers:
1. Navigate to any lot detail page via `/fo-dashboard/plan/{planId}/lots/{lotId}`
2. Scroll down to see the "Compensation Details" section
3. Click "Edit" to modify compensation information
4. Fill in the assessment and compensation breakdown details
5. Set appropriate status values
6. Add any notes or comments
7. Click "Save" to persist the information

### For Other Users:
1. Navigate to lot detail pages from their respective dashboards
2. View the "Compensation Summary" section to see current status
3. See read-only compensation information if available
4. Cannot edit compensation details (locked with visual indicators)

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure:
```
src/
├── components/
│   └── CompensationDetails.jsx      # New compensation management component
├── pages/
│   └── LotDetail.jsx               # Enhanced with compensation functionality
└── routes/
    └── AppRoutes.jsx               # Existing routes (no changes needed)
```

### Data Storage:
```javascript
// localStorage structure
{
  "compensationData": {
    "{planId}_{lotId}": {
      "propertyValuation": "2000000",
      "buildingValue": "300000",
      "treeValue": "50000",
      "cropsValue": "25000",
      "disturbanceAllowance": "100000",
      "solatiumPayment": "75000",
      "additionalCompensation": "50000",
      "totalCompensation": "2600000",
      "paymentStatus": "pending",
      "approvalStatus": "draft",
      "assessmentDate": "2024-01-15",
      "notes": "Assessment notes...",
      "lastUpdated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "lastUpdatedBy": "Financial Officer"
    }
  }
}
```

### Role Detection:
The system determines user role based on the current URL path:
- `/fo-dashboard/*` → Financial Officer (full access)
- `/pe-dashboard/*` → Project Engineer (view only)
- `/ce-dashboard/*` → Chief Engineer (view only)
- `/dashboard/*` → Land Officer (view only)

## Security Features
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized edits
- Visual indicators (lock icons) show permission levels
- Edit buttons are disabled for non-Financial Officers
- Alert messages inform users of permission restrictions

## Future Enhancements
- Backend integration for persistent data storage
- User authentication and session management
- Approval workflow implementation
- Document attachment capabilities
- Audit trail for compensation changes
- Print/export functionality for compensation reports

## Testing
To test the functionality:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5174`
3. Access different dashboard routes to test role-based access
4. Use `/fo-dashboard/plan/8890/lots/L001` to test Financial Officer functionality
5. Use other dashboard routes to test view-only access

## Notes
- The implementation uses localStorage for demonstration purposes
- In production, this should be replaced with proper backend API calls
- The role detection is simplified and should be enhanced with proper authentication
- All currency values are stored as strings to maintain precision
